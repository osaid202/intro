Goal
The goal of this project is to create a Ruby on Rails application using data collected from one or more data sources. This is a two part project.
The first part involves creating the required database tables and pulling data from various data sources. The second part involves using Ruby on Rails to create reports, allow searching, and/or display visualizations based on this data.
The data you use can be pulled from open datasets or public and private APIs. Fake data generated by the Faker gem can also be used, as can data that you scrape from web pages. You may also need to research how best to import data from JSON, XML and CSV sources.
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Using a few Faker generators like Food and nationality, the database around recipes will be populated.
Each recipe has one ethnic category, each category can have 0 or many recipes
Each creator can create 0 or many recipes, each recipe belongs to one creator.
Each recipe contains 1 or many spices, a spice can belong to 0 or many recipes
